# üè† House Price Prediction
#### Year Accomplished : 2024
#### Role/Position : Machine Learning Engineer/Programmer
#### Project Description 
This project was a self-initiated, independent project. In this project, I built a predictive model to estimate house prices based on a cleaned dataset. The results showed that key factors influencing house prices include building area, number of floors, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and basement size. I utilized Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models to perform the predictions. After building the models, I deployed the best-performing model using Streamlit to create a web-based application that can assist in decision-making.
